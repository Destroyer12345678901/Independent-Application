            <p>You and your family decide to get a dog. You are anticipated as you never had a dog before. Your parents are doubtful about the idea, though, because they don't know how to take care of a dog, what dog to buy and how to even train the dog so the dog won't even be so darn dangerous!</p>
            <p>Want me to give you some advice?</p>
            <p>Why not just show this to your parents and let them read it?</p>
        <h1 id="What_Dog_to_Buy">What Dog to Buy?</h1>
        <p>How do you know what dog to buy? Well, we can tell by our personality and our opinion of how we think about the breeds. For example, a grand person would fancy a poodle, or perhaps a Bichon Frise.</p>
        <p>The most common dogs people get are Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, Dachshunds, American Cocker Spaniels and so many more. Amongst them all, who are you going to pick?</p>
        <p>If you hate shedding and vaccuming, which is very common for golden retrievers, you should get a Labradoodle, Bichon Frise, Poodle, Shih Tzu, Portugese Water Dog, etc etc. I'd recommend the Bichon because it's really tiny and teddy-bear-like and cute.</p>
        <p>If you are an extremely bored person and you don't want to live a serious life, just that legendary funny vibe, you might get a pug.</p>
            <img id = "img1" src = "https://dogtime.com/assets/uploads/gallery/shih-tzu-dog-breed-pictures/shih-tzu-breed-picture-1.jpg">
   
        <p>Bulldogs and Pitbulls are very dangerous dogs, although if you see on social media, you can find them really cute. These dogs can actually kill people, as they are very aggressive, more aggressive than the average dog. Watch out and be careful.</p>
        <p>Pugs are the butt of the joke. If you don't know what I mean, search up Pug memes. They are so funny, cute and fat all in one. They can be mischievious sometimes, but affectionate as well, and because they are the butt of the joke, you can get cheered up looking at them.</p>
        <p>You can choose the dog that best suits you. Know that no matter what, your dog is entertaining, funny and cute.</p>
        <h1 id = "Take_Care">How To Take Care of Him Or Her?</h1>
        <p>This is the center of the parent's concern of the dog, believe it or not. How can you take care of the dog, help it go to the bathroom, give it a bath? Oh my god! I don't think we should even have a dog! I AM SO OVERWHELMED! You feel like this when you first get the dog. It is so darn difficult! Trust me, it won't be like this until 2 weeks, roughly, maybe.</p>
        <h3>GOING TO THE BATHROOM</h1>
        <p>When you get a new dog, it's probably going to think this house is its toilet. That's why you should make him or her do it outside. Now, the dog doesn't know the front or backyard is its bathroom, so it doesn't know that, so when you take it out, he or she won't do anything. You see, this is where patience comes into play. </p>
        <p>Wait for it to, you know, do it's business and that's going to take a really long time. Finally, when he or she does it, give her a treat to know she did the right thing.</p>

        <h3>PUT THE SOAP ON HIM! HE SMELLS!</h3>
        <p>Ew! He smells bad!</p>
        <p>You see, when your dog first comes home, he's gonna smell. So bad. I would say it is like a toxic bomb. This is because your dog hasn't had a shower. </p>
        <p>Your going to have to need the following things, </p>
        <h3>Dog Conditioner</h3>
        <h3>Dog Soap</h3>
        <h3>Dog Shampoo</h3>
        <p>I'd suggest getting the preceding items from Tj Maxx</p>
        <p>Your dog is going to be stubborn the first time, and the second time and so on. For the entire first year, after you are done bathing the dog, it will go so crazy hyper and you have to have control of it. Then gradually, it'll calm down.</p>
        <p>Wow! It smells good!</p>
        <h3>IM STARVING!</h3>
        <p>My dog keeps barking and biting me in frustration! If that's so, it's perhaps because he or she is hungry. Give him or her food.</p>
        <p>You might have to get food from Petco. It is a very great place for pets.</p>
        <p>If you have a bell or something that will catch your dog's attention, do that and put the food in the dog bowl and he or she will come running to you and will eat. Give him or her water as well so it can stay hydrated.</p>
        <h1 id = "How_To_Train_Your_Dog">How To Train Your Dog</h1>
        <h3>SIT!</h3>
    <p>For this, your going to heavily depend on the treats you have. </p>
    <p>Your dog will be very dangerous and not obedient to you unless trained.</p>
    <p>Teach your dog how to sit. It will take a while. You might have to push the top part of the backside hard to make him or her sit down.</p>
    <p>After it does so, give a treat to him or her and tell her Good Boy! or Good Girl! and then say Sit! He or she will be aware that it is doing the right thing and will thereby sit when asked to. </p>
     <h3>DOWN!</h3>
    <p>Teach it to lie down. When it lies down on it's bed or on the floor, say Good Boy! if male or Good Girl! if female, and give her a treat to make her know she is doing the right thing, and say Down as you do so.</p>
    <p>When you train her to do more things, you now have a good, friendly dog.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>And so it ends. Once everything you need to do is done, you are very good at your job.</p>
